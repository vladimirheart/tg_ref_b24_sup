# SQLite migration guide

This project uses Flyway to build the canonical PostgreSQL schema. The `scripts/export_sqlite_to_sql.py` helper extracts
existing SQLite data into a set of `INSERT` statements that can be executed against a PostgreSQL or MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Access to the SQLite backups (`tickets.db`, `users.db`, `bot_database.db`)
* A target PostgreSQL or MySQL database that already contains the schema produced by the Flyway migrations

## Export workflow

1. From the repository root run the exporter for the desired dialect:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/export_sqlite_to_sql.py --dialect postgresql --output /tmp/import-postgres.sql
   # or for MySQL
   ./scripts/export_sqlite_to_sql.py --dialect mysql --output /tmp/import-mysql.sql
   ```

   The script preserves primary keys, rewrites renamed columns (for example `notifications.user` â†’ `user_identity`) and
   normalises boolean values so that they match the target database representation. When the PostgreSQL dialect is used
   the SQL file also contains `SELECT setval` statements that adjust the identity sequences after import.

2. Execute the generated script inside the target database:

   ```bash
   # PostgreSQL
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f /tmp/import-postgres.sql

   # MySQL
   mysql --user=<user> --password --database=<schema> < /tmp/import-mysql.sql
   ```

   All statements are wrapped in a single transaction so either the whole data set is loaded or nothing is changed.

3. After the import completes validate a few core aggregates to ensure that row counts line up with the source
   SQLite database, for example:

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM panel_users;
   ```

## Table coverage

The exporter handles every table present in the three SQLite files and maps them to the equivalent Flyway-managed
schema. If additional tables are added in the future extend the `MIGRATION_PLAN` constant in
`scripts/export_sqlite_to_sql.py` with the source and target column mapping.

## Verification

After importing the data run the Spring Boot application; Flyway will validate the schema on start-up and any
inconsistencies will be reported in the logs. Repository tests (see `spring-panel/src/test/java`) provide an
additional safety net by exercising the most important entity mappings under the migrated schema.
